- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGreenFIash (aka Greenie, TGF)
- 👀 I’m interested in game development in Scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to design game engines with a focus on useful features and an intuitive interface.
- 💞️ Because of how busy I am with college, I’m not currently looking to collaborate.
- 📫 Reach me on Discord @TheGreenFlash. I'm less active but still present on YouTube, Scratch, and Game Jolt under the same name.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was interested in performing arts before I got into programming.
